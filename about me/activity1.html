                    <p>
                        I have always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us.
                        From apps that connect people globally to software that powers life-saving medical devices,
                        the possibilities seem endless. This curiosity sparked my desire to learn software engineering —
                        not just to understand how these systems work, but to build innovative solutions myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Learning software engineering allows me to combine creativity and logic to solve real-world problems.
                        I want to become part of the growing community that builds tools to make people’s lives easier and more efficient.

                    <p>
                        My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who can design, develop, and deploy impactful applications.
                        I want to gain deep knowledge of programming languages, algorithms, databases, and system design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the long term, I hope to contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with diverse teams, and perhaps
                        start my own tech initiative that solves meaningful problems — from education accessibility to environmental sustainability.
